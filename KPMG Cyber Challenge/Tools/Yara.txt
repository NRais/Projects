Goal: Malware episode 2


1) Yara Lab 1

- "strings <filename>" return ascii strings in filename
- "xxd <filename>" hex of a file
- "cat <filename>" return file
- "cat <filename> | grep <string>"
- "strings <file> | grep -i <strings>" case insensitive
- "grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" find IP addresses

- tried things like "strings file2 | grep 'classPK'" and ascertained that all malware contained "adwind" and "classPK"

2) Yara Lab 2

- "grep -w <string> <filename>" where -w means a whole word not a substring
- "-i" ignore case
- "-r" search subdirectories
- "-v" inverse search (for things that do not include)
- "-A 3" print 3 lines after "-B 3" print 3 lines before "-C 2" prints 2 before and after

- Searched for the following strings in both files:
sqlite3
client.exe
design991.bplaced.net/rat/@1906dark1996coder
WExtract.exe

3) Yara Lab 3

4) Yara Lab 4

- "strings -n 5 <file>" to set min length

5) Yara Lab 5

6) Yara Lab 6

rule ExampleRule {

	strings:
		$text = "CMemoryExcecute"
		$header = "MZ"
		
	condition:
